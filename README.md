### Powerbank
The powerbank has a hugh capacity of 26800mAh. When ESP32 is in deep sleep the entire electronic draws a current of <=2mA. If the current draw from powerbank is about <70mA the powerbank automatically turns off its outputs after 30 seconds. Then the electronic has no chance to power up unless the button of powerbank is pressed to switch it on again. I figured out that the powerbank has two DCDC converters: IP5306 and IP5310. Both chips can be configured via I2C. I found the I2C protocol of IP5306 on github: [github link](https://github.com/bheesma-10/IP5306_I2C) but no chance for IP5310. For IP5306 there is a register bit which can be set to tell the chip to stay on. Unfortunatelly this bit is not the same for IP5310. Why not using IP5306 instead of IP5310? Because I could get access only to I2C pins of IP5310 via charging state LEDs. The next problem is that IP5310 is responsible for battery charging.

I soldered I2C wires to the LEDs which are connected to IP5310 and tried to write to different registers and voila! Bit 7 of register 0x02 tells the chip to stay on.
What else? The powerbank on/off switch is connected to IP5306. As soon as IP5306 wakes up, it will wake up IP5310 via transitor. Therefore I had to do some modifications on powerbank PCB.
